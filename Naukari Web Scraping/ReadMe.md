# Naukri Web Scraping for Jobs Data Extraction

## Introduction
This project involves web scraping job data from the Naukri job portal using Python. The goal is to extract job listings, including details such as job title, company name, location, experience required, and job description. The extracted data is then stored in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

## Approach
To achieve this, we follow these steps:

1. **User Input**: We begin by taking user input for the number of pages to scrape, allowing flexibility in the amount of data to extract.

2. **Web Scraping Loop**: We iterate through each page, scraping job listings. We use Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries for web scraping.

3. **Data Extraction**: For each job listing on a page, we extract the following information:
   - Job Title
   - Job URL
   - Company Name
   - Experience Required
   - Location
   - Posting Date
   - Job Description

4. **Data Processing**: We clean and process the extracted data. If any information is missing, we handle it gracefully.

5. **Data Storage**: We append the extracted data to a Pandas DataFrame for each page.

6. **Closing the Web Driver**: After scraping all the data from a page, we close the web driver.

7. **Duplicate Removal**: To ensure data integrity, we remove duplicate entries from the DataFrame.

8. **Data Export (Optional)**: The final DataFrame can be exported to an Excel file for further analysis.

## Knowledge and Skills
This project demonstrates the following skills and knowledge:
- Python programming for web scraping.
- Use of Selenium for automated web browsing.
- Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup.
- Handling missing data gracefully.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Storing data in a Pandas DataFrame.
- Removing duplicates to maintain data integrity.

## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:
1. Install the required Python libraries (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Pandas).
2. Download and configure the ChromeDriver for your system.
3. Replace the provided URL with the Naukri job search URL of your choice.
4. Run the Python script, and it will scrape job data based on your specified criteria.

Please note that web scraping should be done responsibly and in compliance with the website's terms of service. Be mindful of website policies and rate limiting to avoid any disruptions.

**Note**: It is advisable to set a reasonable number of pages to scrape to prevent overloading the website and potential IP blocking.
